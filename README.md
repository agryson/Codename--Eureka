#Intro
*Codename: Eureka* is the working title for a space colony sim I've been working on for a little while

The web is most certainly the future (and arguably the present) of computing, but when it comes to games there's still something lacking.
The vast majority (arguably _all_) modern browser based games are what could be considered "casual", the type of game designed to be played for short periods of time, with little personal investment in the experience over a longer period of time.
While I love casual games, I also love marshmallows - that doesn't mean marshmallows should be all I eat.

With *Codename: Eureka*, we on the team are hoping to provide a richer, more in-depth and engaging game.

Mainly prototypes for the moment until design has progressed more.
If it sounds like something you'd like to take part in, please get in touch!
This is not just about code, we need creative writers, artists, musical types - any skill you have could be useful.
